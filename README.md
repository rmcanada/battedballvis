# battedballvis

This code is a proposed solution to project 3

index.html is a d3 based web application file. 
it accesses the batted ball data from the included csv (ALWestBattedBalls2017.csv)

To run the program, clone the repository to your machine, and from the directory run the command:
  
  python -m http.server

in your browser head to the exposed port, default should be localhost:8000
